        The organization through mediation, dialogue and research opts to look into cross
        cutting issues for both women and men; girls and boys; aged and disabled to foster
        inclusion and promote sustainable fair share in the rural areas.

                Malaria and climate change are interconnected and have a significant impact on
                each other. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite,
                which is primarily transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Climate change,
                on the other hand, refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns caused
                by human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases.

                <code>Relationship between malaria and climate change:</code>
                <code>1.Vector Distribution:</code> Climate change can affect the distribution, abundance,
                and behavior of malaria vectors, such as mosquitoes. Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall
                patterns can expand the geographical range of these vectors, allowing them to thrive in areas
                where malaria was previously absent or rare.
                <code>2.Transmission Season:</code> Changes in climate can also influence the length and intensity
                of the malaria transmission season. In warmer regions, longer transmission seasons can occur,
                increasing the overall risk of malaria infections. Extended periods of rainfall and higher humidity
                can create more breeding sites for mosquitoes, leading to increased transmission.
                <code>3.Altitude and Highland Areas:</code> Climate change may also impact malaria transmission in 
                highland areas. As temperatures rise, previously cooler regions may become suitable for malaria 
                transmission, exposing populations that have limited immunity to the disease. This could lead to a
                higher incidence of malaria in areas where it was historically uncommon.
                <code>4.Human Vulnerability:</code> Climate change can also affect human vulnerability to malaria.
                Extreme weather events like floods or droughts, which can be influenced by climate change, can disrupt
                malaria control measures, such as insecticide spraying or distribution of bed nets. Displaced populations
                and weakened health systems following such events can create favorable conditions for malaria transmission.
                <code>5.Future Projections:</code> Climate models suggest that malaria may spread to new areas and become more
                widespread in already endemic regions due to climate change. However, it's important to note that climate 
                change is not the sole factor driving malaria transmission, and other factors such as socioeconomic conditions,
                access to healthcare, and vector control measures also play significant roles.
                Addressing the intersection of malaria and climate change requires a comprehensive approach that includes both
                malaria control measures (such as vector control, early diagnosis, and treatment) and efforts to mitigate and
                adapt to climate change (such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing climate-resilient strategies).
                Collaboration between the health sector, environmental agencies, and policymakers is crucial to effectively combat
                the impact of climate change on malaria and protect vulnerable populations.

        <h3>mitigation</h3>
        <p>through educating the community and carrying out various mitigation measures,

            Some examples of mitigation measures include:
            <code>Renewable energy:</code> This includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric and
            biomass energy. Renewable energy sources are considered clean because they do not produce greenhouse gases.
            <code>Energy efficiency:</code> This involves using less energy to perform the same tasks.
            For example, using LED light bulbs instead of incandescent bulbs.
            <code>Carbon capture and storage:</code> This involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions
            from power plants and other industrial sources and storing them underground or in other locations
            where they will not enter the atmosphere.
            <code>Afforestation:</code> This involves planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
            <code>Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation:</code> This involves reducing emissions
            from deforestation and forest degradation by providing incentives for developing countries to conserve their forests2.
